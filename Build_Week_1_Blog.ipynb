        "The effective altruism community is a group of nerds, but instead of nerding out about train engines, Star Wars, or 18th-century swordfighting, they nerd out about one question: Given limited resources and all of humanity's accumulated knowledge about the social and physical sciences, what is the most cost-effective way to improve the world? \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "While the focus began on figuring out which charity is the best place to spend your marginal dollar, and much work still focuses on how to do that, the EA community has expanded to questions of how analytic, altruistic-minded people should best allocate their time and social capital, as well.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "People in the community have settled on several possible answers to the question, \"Of all the problems to work on, which is the problem EAs should most focus on?\" Some examples of those answers include animal welfare, improving general societal rationality, or improving biosecurity measures against engineered or accidental pandemics. (Notably, members of the community personally prepared for COVID weeks before their governments enacted emergency orders.) \n",
        "\n",
        "For years, I've assumed that the differences in cause area selection are determined by people's prior beliefs, i.e. if you believe animals are [\"moral patients\"](https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/concepts/moral-patienthood/) in the philosophy lingo, then you're more likely to prioritize animal welfare; if you believe currently living people are moral patients and people who haven't been born yet are not, then you're more likely to prioritize global poverty reduction (over e.g. [existential risk](https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/concepts/existential-risks/) reduction). \n",
        "\n",
        "However, with the fresh acquisition of some basic data science skills and some [anonymized survey data](https://github.com/rethinkpriorities/ea-data/tree/master/data), I thought of an interesting question: Do a person's personality traits affect which cause area they're likely to prioritize? And if so, how?\n",
        "\n",
        "You see, in 2018, the EA-affiliated (but not me-affiliated!) organization [Rethink Charity](https://rtcharity.org/) included optional questions at the end of their annual community survey which directed people to take a scientifically-validated [Big Five](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits) personality test, so we have data on how nearly 1200 members of the EA community score on traits of openness, extroversion, conscientiousness, agreeableness, and \"emotional stability\" (in the survey data and in this analysis, the opposite of the trait usually labeled in Big Five inventories as \"neuroticism\") .\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "If you're already familiar with the EA community, then just for fun, you could try making some guesses about the relationships between personality traits and cause prioritization before you scroll down.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the interest of transparent calibration, I'll divulge the three conjectures I jotted down prior to running any of my statistical tests. I expected higher openness to correlate with x-risk prioritization, higher conscientiousness to correlate with animal welfare prioritization, and lower emotional stability to correlate with prioritizing mental health interventions. None of my predictions were born out by my data. \n",
        "\n",
        "This post won't say anything about how survey respondents differed from the general public (though an acquaintance offers [some interesting conjecture on that question here](http://danielgambacorta.com/podcast/the-personality-of-effective-altruists-part-i/)). This post only compares groups within the EA community to each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "(Epistemic notes: Obviously, I was hoping for something interesting to write about, and tried an unproductive tack before settling on the following statistical tests, but I was also prepared for an answer affirming the null hypothesis, i.e. that there is no correlation between personality traits and cause prioritization, and was prepared to write a blog post with that message. My confidence interval cutoff was the common Schelling point of 95% for non-medical research. Out of 55 2-sample t-tests, we would expect 2 to come out \"statistically significant\" due to random chance, but I found 10, so we can expect most of these to point to actually meaningful differences represented in the survey data.)\n",
        "\n",
        "Within the 2018 survey, respondents had to assign an importance level to each of 11 potential cause areas: animal welfare, climate change, mental health, global poverty, overall rationality, \"meta\" causes like community building, cause prioritization research (i.e. what other cause areas have we not thought of yet?), biosecurity, nuclear security, AI safety, and a final catch-all cause area for other, unspecified existential risks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Respondents had to assign one of the following importance levels, in descending order: \"This cause should be the top priority,\" \"This cause should be a near-top priority,\" \"This cause deserves significant resources but less than the top priorities,\" \"I do not think this is a priority, but should receive some resources,\" and \"I do not think any resources should be devoted to this cause.\" Respondents could also select \"Not sure\" as a response.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are many ways to approach this topic that I did not attempt. For this post, for each cause area, I pitted the group of people who picked the cause as their topmost priority against the group of people who said the cause should receive no resources. And I found some *interesting* stuff.\n",
        "\n",
        "Before you look at any graphs, I want you to note that obviously, the overlap between any two groups I compared was always much greater than the groups' differences.\n",

        "People who rate animal welfare their top priority on average have lower emotional stability scores than people who say no resources should be devoted to animal welfare, with a p-value of 0.026. (Those groups differed the *least* on openness.)\n",

        "Sidebar: It's common to think of some of the big five personality traits as being straightforwardly desirable or undesirable, but I think it's actually the case that the goodness and badness of e.g. conscientiousness is actually context-dependent.
